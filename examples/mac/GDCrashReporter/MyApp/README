Here's how to implement the GDKit Crash Reporter in your own application.

1. Put GDKit-Mac in your Framework search path.
2. Link against the GDKit-Mac Framework
3. Add a new Copy Files build phase to copy the GDKit-Mac framework into the
   applications Frameworks. For an example you can look at this applications
   "Copy Frameworks" build phase. Right click on it and select Get Info.
4. Update the Info.plist file with the necessary entries. (See this app
   for an example).
5. Update the main.m file to return GDCrashReporter_NSApplicationMain()
   function call. (See this application's main.m file).
